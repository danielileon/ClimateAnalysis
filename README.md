# Climate Analysis

Welcome to my climate analysis project! The goal of this project is to use publically available data in order to draw conclusions surrounding the change in temperature across the globe over time at the city, state, national, and international levels. Please explore the Jupyter Notebooks for visualizations of the climate change over the past few centuries.

The data used for this project was accessed at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data, which was create by the Berkely Earth account. Access was made through a Creative Commons license, Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0). No changes were made to the data, and this project has been shared under the same license (which can be found at https://github.com/danielileon/ClimateAnalysis/blob/main/LICENSE) for noncommerical purposes.
